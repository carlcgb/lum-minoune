# Cursor Rules — Enhanced Boutique E-commerce Website

## Project Goal
Create a totally new, enhanced version of the reference website:
https://lm-by-karine.square.site/

The new site must NOT be a visual or structural clone.
It should feel premium, modern, immersive, and custom-built.

This is a boutique e-commerce shop experience with strong emphasis on:
- Aesthetic design
- Conversion
- Micro-interactions
- Cursor-driven UX enhancements

---

## Reference Usage Rules
- Use the reference site ONLY to understand:
  - Type of business (boutique / beauty / lifestyle shop)
  - Product-driven layout
  - E-commerce needs (catalog, product cards, CTA flow)
- Do NOT replicate:
  - Layout structure
  - Spacing
  - Colors
  - Typography
  - Section order
- The final result must be clearly distinguishable and original.

---

## Design Direction
- Premium boutique feel
- Modern editorial layouts
- Soft luxury (not corporate, not generic)
- Clean negative space
- Subtle animations over heavy effects

Design should feel:
- Hand-crafted
- Elegant
- Trustworthy
- Conversion-focused

---

## Cursor & Interaction System (High Priority)

### Cursor Principles
- Default system cursor must be replaced on desktop
- Cursor is a core interaction element, not decoration
- Cursor behavior should adapt based on context

### Required Cursor Behaviors
- Smooth animated cursor follower (spring or lerp-based motion)
- Cursor scales or morphs on:
  - Buttons
  - Links
  - Product cards
  - Add-to-cart CTAs
- Cursor displays contextual states, such as:
  - “View”
  - “Shop”
  - “Add”
- Cursor interaction must feel intentional and performant

### Cursor Constraints
- Cursor effects must never block usability
- Cursor must be disabled automatically on touch devices
- Fallback to native cursor if JavaScript fails

---

## Motion & Micro-Interactions
- Use subtle hover animations on:
  - Product cards
  - Images
  - Buttons
- Prefer transforms and opacity over layout shifts
- Avoid excessive animation durations
- Motion should guide attention, not distract

---

## E-commerce UX Rules
- Product discovery must be fast and clear
- CTAs must always remain obvious
- Add-to-cart and checkout flow should feel lightweight
- Visual hierarchy must prioritize products and pricing
- No experimental UI that harms conversion

---

## Accessibility & Performance
- Respect reduced motion preferences
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Cursor enhancements must not break keyboard navigation
- Optimize for performance (no heavy cursor particle systems)

---

## Technical Expectations
- Write clean, readable, modular code
- Favor modern CSS (flex, grid, variables)
- Use lightweight vanilla JS or minimal libraries
- Avoid overengineering

---

## React / Frontend Architecture Rules
- Prefer React with functional components
- Cursor logic must be component-based and reusable
- Cursor state should be managed globally (Context or store)
- Cursor must respond to component-level intent (hover, focus, active)
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation unless strictly necessary
- Cursor animation should use requestAnimationFrame or motion libraries
- Components must remain usable if cursor enhancements are disabled

---

## Output Expectations
When generating code or designs:
- Assume this is a production-grade website
- Prioritize maintainability
- Avoid placeholders unless explicitly requested
- Explain cursor-related logic when relevant

---

## Decision Priority Order
1. Usability
2. Conversion
3. Visual clarity
4. Cursor & motion polish
5. Aesthetic details
